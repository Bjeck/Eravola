Text is Text
[see if I can mod 2 text fields in]
Sprite - dunno if/how yet.
Audio - could be useful for somethign
extraData: Text roll info:
 - s = Speed. s,1 is speed 1

Extra Variables
 - isConversation = is it a conversation? informs text placement.
 - delay = delay, time until choices will show up. (other things that need delay?)
 - c = Color c,grey is grey color (maybe could use sprite for this??) (problem is in-string color)


Action: Load next dialogue (string parameter - maybe enum??)




Naming Convention for Dialogues:
 - MainCharacter_Arch_OtherPersonOrEvent_nr 
 - Tari_Pond_Ceara_1





There's an OnActionNode(id). that's good to remember.
